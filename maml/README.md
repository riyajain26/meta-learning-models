# MAML: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning

This folder contains a simple implementation of the MAML algorithm using PyTorch.

## Contents

- `model.py` : Defines the MAML model architecture.
- `train.py` : Script to train the MAML model on a dummy dataset.
- `eval.py` : Placeholder script for evaluating the MAML model.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have all dependencies installed:

    pip install -r ../requirements.txt

2. Run training:

    python train.py

3. Evaluation script will be added soon.
